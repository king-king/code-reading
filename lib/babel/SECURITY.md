# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This is the list of versions of `babel` which are
currently being supported with security updates.

| Version  | Supported          |
| -------- | ------------------ |
| 7.x      | :white_check_mark: |
| 6.x      | :x:                |

Note that for each supported major version, we will only provide security fixes for the last minor version. This means that if, for example, the last released version is 7.16.4 we will only release security fixes as 7.16.5 and not for 7.15.x or older.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability please send an email with the details to security@babeljs.io. 
This will help us to assess the risk and start the necessary steps.

Thanks for helping to keep babel secure.
