- [ ] ~~stop serializing options and instead accept webpack config file path and populate fake loader context with that so that worker loaders get access to external options~~
- [x] pitching loader applier
- [ ] pass loader options found on the compiler by the loader name to the loader, like `options.transform` or `options.sassLoader`
- [ ] accept modified `resourcePath` from pitching phase and re-read the source
- [ ] delay reading the source file until the very point where we need it; pitch
- [ ] replay loader RPCs for items cached by loaders like `tslint-loader` where the output is actually RPCs like `this.emitWarning` and `this.emitError`
- [ ] better coverage for background loader failures
- [ ] caching test
- [ ] experiment with not serializing worker output to file and instead shoving things down the process stream (ie `compiledPath` shizzle)
